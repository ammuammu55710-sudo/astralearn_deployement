# 🚀 AstraLearn - AI & Community Enhancements

I have significantly upgraded the platform's core AI and collaborative features. Below is a summary of what's new and how it works:

## 🧠 Advanced AI Features

### 1. **True AI Study Group Matching**
- **Old**: Simple keyword matching.
- **New**: Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to analyze your interests and learning styles against all available groups to find the top 3 best academic matches.
- **How to use**: Visit the **Groups** page. If you have interests set in your profile, you'll see a "MATCH" sub-section with groups specifically chosen for you by AI.

### 2. **AI Study Admin** (Updated)
- All AI scheduling and exam generation now uses the stable **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model.
- Schedules are more detailed, providing topic names, daily notes, and estimated study times.

### 3. **AI Doubt Assistant (Premium UI)**
- **Thinking Animation**: You can now see when "Astra AI is thinking..."
- **Fade-in Messages**: Smooth transitions for a more modern chat feel.
- **Persistent History**: Your doubts and AI responses are saved to your profile.

## 🤝 Community & Collaboration

### 1. **Doubt Peer Community**
- **Community Q&A**: A brand new forum-style system where you can post doubts to the entire AstraLearn community.
- **Answer System**: Peer-to-peer answering system where anyone can contribute knowledge.
- **Subject Filtering**: Easily find doubts in your specific field of study.

### 2. **Branch-Specific Portal**
- **Personalized Access**: A dedicated portal that filters Groups and Doubts specifically for your academic branch (e.g., CSE, ECE, MECH).
- **Branch-Only Feed**: Stay updated with what's happening in your specific department.

## 📊 Analytics Dashboard

- **Overall Progress**: See your completion percentage across all joined study groups.
- **Activity Metrics**: Track how many doubts you've solved using AI and how many notes you've created.
- **Quick Access**: New shortcuts to the **Branch Portal** and **Doubt Peer** community.

## 👤 Profile & Permissions

- **Branch Selection**: You can now specify your branch in your profile.
- **Faculty Role**: Support for Faculty accounts has been added for future administrative features.

## 🛠️ Performance & Stability

- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Switched to the latest stable model to prevent "Model Not Found" errors.
- **Safe API Handling**: Added timeouts and better error messages for AI requests.
- **JSON Parsing**: More robust parsing for AI-generated schedules and exams.

## 🎯 Next Steps

I am ready to implement the **Faculty Portal** (Marks & Attendance) or refine the **Real-time Whiteboard** in the Collaboration Room.
